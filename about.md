[Handshake](https://handshake.com) Engineering is a team of technologists dedicated to connecting great brands to local retailers with great software. The software we build replaces the antiquated pen-and-paper based systems used by brands and their salespeople, allowing for more products to reach more retailers with less cost, at greater speed and with less environmental impact.

### Our Challenges

### Our Stack

We try to use the right tool for the job, and as few tools as are necessary to get the job done. Our minimalistic stack is optimized for heterogony, flexibility and interoperability. We reserve the right to change our mind, and our stack, to meet the needs of emerging problems:

 * Our inf is built on `managed hosting`, but will soon be on `AWS` or `RackSpace`
 * We use `salt` for configuration management.
 * We use `fab` to deploy.
 * We use `git` for source control.
 * Our database is `PostgreSQL`, but we also use `Redis`.
 * We have one big `Django` app, but are moving towards REST micro-services.
 * We are nearly done porting to a single universal `iOS` app.
 * We use `Backbone.js` on the Front-End.
 * We also use `CoffeeScript`, though there is some debate about this.
