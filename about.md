[Handshake](https://handshake.com) Engineering is a team of technologists dedicated to connecting great brands to local retailers with great software. The software we build replaces the antiquated pen-and-paper based systems used by brands and their salespeople, allowing for more products to reach more retailers with less cost, at greater speed and with less environmental impact.

### Our Challenges

Increasing the reach of great brands, and improving the lives of their team is a big challenge. Solving this one problem requires great UX, extremely fast and extensible data-stores, and a framework allowing for trivial integration with their existing tools.

#### Faster Than The Pen

Before Handshake, the state-of-the-art in sales was pen and paper. Orders were taken by hand, faxed, and hand-entered into an [ERP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning) by a data-entry specialists. Providing a better experience starts with being simpler and faster than pen and paper. Sounds simple right? Well, it turns out that the pen is pretty fast, especially when you use short-hand. This one challenge leads us to continuously explore new and increasingly efficient interfaces for our users.

### Our Stack

We try to use the right tool for the job, and as few tools as are necessary to get the job done. Our minimalistic stack is optimized for heterogony, flexibility and interoperability. We reserve the right to change our mind, and our stack, to meet the needs of emerging problems:

 * Our inf is built on `managed hosting`, but will soon be on `AWS` or `RackSpace`
 * We use `salt` for configuration management.
 * We use `fab` to deploy.
 * We use `git` for source control.
 * Our database is `PostgreSQL`, but we also use `Redis`.
 * We have one big `Django` app, but are moving towards REST micro-services.
 * We are nearly done porting to a single universal `iOS` app.
 * We use `Backbone.js` on the Front-End.
 * We also use `CoffeeScript`, though there is some debate about this.
